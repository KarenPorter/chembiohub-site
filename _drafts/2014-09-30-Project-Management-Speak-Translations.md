## A Glossary of Project Management speak
One repeated criticism I have heard since I arrived in December 2013 is that my language is “Project Management-speak” and not the scientific language typical of users of ChemBio Hub.  Sorry about that - I am trying hard to learn the local idiom - but I’m also keen to share some of my own terminology and approach.   Just as I need to understand issues the relevant scientific community has, and how they are expressed, there is also likely to be something that I can share of my own expertise which is useful (with a little bit of translation), so here are some key definitions which might help:

- **Project** – is defined as a temporary organisation that is created for the purpose of delivering one or more products.  It has elements of:
	- **Change** – projects are the means by which organisations introduce change
	- **Temporary** – projects should have a defined start and end.  Once the project has ended, the organisation reverts to the state of _business as usual_ (though this might be in a new state after the project has delivered)
	- **Cross-functional** – projects involve people with different skills working together in a team to make changes which impact wider than that team.  This can cause stress depending on previous working practices and individuals' motivation for involvement in the project.
	- **Unique** – although we may use proven techniques and approaches, differences in the team, users and problem being tackled make each project unique.
	- **Uncertainty** – the elements above combine to introduce risk, an unavoidable feature of a project.

- **Agile** – this is a term used for the software development approach we are using.  It was introduced in 2001 although some of the underlying principles have been around since the 1950s.  The Agile Manifesto promotes:
	- **Individuals and interactions** over Processes and tools
	- **Working software** over Comprehensive documentation
	- **Customer collaboration** over Contract negotiation
	- **Responding to change** over Following a plan
    
	- These are delivered by a range of specific techniques and approaches including:
		- Being collocated, promoting ownership, close engagement with users.  Change happens _with_ users rather than _to_ users 
		- Delivering functionality (very regularly) and measuring _that_ rather than pages of documents 
		- Getting regular feedback from users in response to showing them functions - and responding to it.
		- As the name suggests, being able and willing to change priorities based on the feedback. This is done in a controlled way to ensure that the project isn’t affected to the extent that it fails to deliver anything because the focus constantly changes.

- **Sprint** – is a specifically defined _duration_ of effort – typically between a week and a month - during which the team commit to produce defined _functionality_.
At the beginning of a sprint, we hold a planning meeting to define the tasks needed to produce working functionality and at the end we conduct a sprint review to check progress against plan and check if there are an lessons which need to be incorporated into future sprints.

Future blog posts will introduce other project management terms, such as lessons learned and risk management.

We will also have entries themed on the technology used and the science supported.
