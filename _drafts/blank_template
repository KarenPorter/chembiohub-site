Posts on the blog use Markdown, a simple language which is essentially shorthand for web content. Markdown gets turned into HTML by the server automatically.

The 5 lines at the top of the page need to be present in every post. Just change the title and author lines for your post. Leave the line layout:post - this tells the server to use the post template to add styling information and make every post consistent.

Ordinary paragraphs can just be typed

*bullet
*lists
*like
*this

Links work like this: [link text in square brackets](http://www.example.com)

images work like this:
![alt text](chembiohub_site/assets/images/file_name.jpg "Title")
where alt text is what will be shown if the image fails to load, "Title" is what is displayed when hovering over the image, and the image path is where the image is loaded from - if it is an external image (hotlinking) just use the url of the image here. If it is an image you want to add, change the file_name and speak to Paul or Andrew to sort out adding the file on the server.

There is a really useful intro to markdown here:
https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics

When you are done creating your entry, you need to specify the file name for your entry in the box next to _drafts. the format for this, so it gets picked up by the server, is YYYY-MM-DD-some-dash-separated-title.md For example 2014-09-02-my-new-blog-post.md This indicates that the file has been written in Markdown and will show as preview when you click the file in the list.

When you've done this just click "Commit New File". You can look at a preview of your file and go back and edit your file later.

When you're happy with your entry, Paul or Andrew will make it live.
